# Taints and Tolerations in Kubernetes
Taints and tolerations in Kubernetes are a way to ensure that certain nodes in a cluster only run certain pods.

Taints:A taint is a property you can apply to a node, marking it as "tainted". This means that no pod will be scheduled to run on it, unless the pod has a matching toleration. In Kubernetes, taints can be assigned one of three effects: NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule, and NoExecute.

NoSchedule: This is the hardest restriction. It means that no pod will be scheduled on the node unless it has a matching toleration.

PreferNoSchedule: This is a softer version of NoSchedule. The system will try to avoid placing a pod that doesn't have a matching toleration on the node, but it's not a hard requirement.

NoExecute: This means that pods without a matching toleration will be evicted from the node if they are already running. If a pod has a matching toleration, it can continue running.

Toleration:A toleration is a property you can apply to a pod, allowing it to be scheduled on nodes with matching taints.

## Task:
Create a deployment with 3 NGINX pods that can tolerate a specific taint.
Create a deployment with 3 NGINX pods without tolerations.
Label a node with a taint to restrict pod scheduling.
Deploy both configurations and ensure pods are running on the appropriate nodes.

### Creating a deployment with toleration
```sh
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: deployment-with-toleration
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app-1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app-1
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: pod-container-1
        image: nginx
      tolerations:
      - key: "app"
        operator: "Equal"
        value: "res-intensive"
        effect: "NoSchedule"
```
This YAML defines a `Deployment` with the specified container and toleration settings, ensuring that three replicas of the `pod` are created

### Creating a deployment without toleration
```sh
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: deployment-without-toleration
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app-2
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app-2
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: pod-container-2
        image: nginx
```
### Applying Taints on node
#### Identifying the `node`to taints:
```sh
kubectl get nodes
```
this will provide the names of `nodes` in the `cluster`.

Assuming `node1`= desired `<Node-name>`

#### Apply the taint to the node (`node1`):
```sh
kubectl taint nodes node1 app=res-intensive:NoSchedule
```
This command applies a taint with the key `app`, value `res-intensive`, and effect `NoSchedule` to node1.

### We can also apply taint with a specific effect (Optional):

kubectl taint nodes node1 key=value:PreferNoSchedule
kubectl taint nodes node1 key=value:NoExecute
### Applying the Deployments
```sh
kubectl apply -f deployment1.yaml
kubectl apply -f deployment2.yaml
```
### Verify the pods
```sh
kubectl get pods -o wide
```
This will display more information about each pod, including the node each pod is running on

### Shortcomings in Taints & Toleration
Pods that have toleration can be ended up with nodes which is not desired.
