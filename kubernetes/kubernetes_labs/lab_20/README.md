# Kubernetes Service Using ClusterIP
### ClusterIP
![alt text](images/image-1.png)

ClusterIP is the default service type in Kubernetes, and it provides internal connectivity between different components of our application. Kubernetes assigns a virtual IP address to a ClusterIP service that can solely be accessed from within the cluster during its creation. This IP address is stable and doesnâ€™t change even if the pods behind the service are rescheduled or replaced.

## Task: Accessing Kubernetes Services via ClusterIP
This guide outlines the steps to create a nginx-deployment service and accessing the service using clusterIP. The final goal is to access the targeted nginx-pod and curl the application using ClusterIP internally within the cluster.

### Prerequisites
Install vim for creating YAML files in the system.
```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install vim
```
### Required Steps
#### 1. Create Nginx-deployment File
Let's create a Nginx-deployment file with three replica of pods running:
```sh
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```
use `vim nginx-deployment.yaml` and write the yaml file pressing `i` for INSERT and exit using `esc` and `:wq`.

Now, see the yaml file using cat nginx-deployment.yaml.

#### 2. Create Nginx-service File
Let's write a YAML manifest file for the Nginx-deployment file which specifies the service type as NodePort, allowing external access to the service.
```sh
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIP
```
use `vim nginx-service.yaml` and write the yaml file pressing `i` for INSERT and exit using `esc` and `:wq`.

Now, see the yaml file using `cat nginx-service.yaml`.

#### 3. Create Deployment and Service
To create the deployment and service, run the following commands:
```sh
kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f nginx-service.yaml
```
#### 4. Check Deployment and Service
Check the status of the deployment using:
```sh
kubectl get deployments
```
Check the status of the service using:
```sh
kubectl get services
```
We can also get all the information by using `kubectl get all`

If the pods and services are runnung, we are ready for accessing Nginx using ClusterIP within the cluster.

#### 5. Get the ClusterIP
To get the clusterIP of the service in a Kubernetes cluster, we can use the kubectl command-line tool to fetch this information. Here's how:
```sh
kubectl get services
```

#### 6. Curl using ClusterIP
We can access the Nginx server through the clusterIP of the nginx service internally.
```sh
curl http://10.43.144.74:80
```
